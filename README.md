# Flatiron-project-4
For this project, I had a dataset detailing the median rent prices of different zipcodes throughout the US, going from 1996 to 2018. Looking primarily at the zipcodes of Brooklyn, I used an ARIMA model to forecast the prices through the next 50 years to determine which areas were most worth investing in.
